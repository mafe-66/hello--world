# hello--world
repository for first steps on github

Hello everybody,
Markus here and I am interested in Raspberry Pi projects for home automation.
Just started with monitoring and tracking of production and consumption of my E3dc pv-installation.
Special thanks to Nishram for great support!
Works good now!
